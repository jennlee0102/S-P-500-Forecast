# Background
The financial markets, represented by indices like the S&P 500 (SP500), are influenced by various economic factors. One factor can be the unemployment rate (UNRATE), which reflects the health of the labor market and, consequently, consumer spending and overall economic activity. Understanding the relationship between these variables can provide insights into market and inform investment decisions.

# Objective
The objective of this project is to develop an ARMAX (AutoRegressive Moving Average with eXogenous input) model incorporating the unemployment rate as an exogenous predictor to forecast the future movements of the S&P 500 index. By leveraging historical data on both the S&P 500 and the unemployment rate, we aim to build a predictive model that captures the interdependencies between these variables.
